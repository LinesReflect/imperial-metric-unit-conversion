Imperial/Metric Unit Converter

This project was made after learning new skills from a free online course. 

The purpose of the converter is to convert Imperial units into Metric units, and with the click of a button, vice versa.

It was not too difficult for the most part, but the logic behind putting the text for all 3 conversions stumped me for a bit. I eventually came up with a solution, but I am not sure if it is the best possible solution.
